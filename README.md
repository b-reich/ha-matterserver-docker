## Homeassistant Matterserver Docker Image
Hi, I provide a working Docker Image for the Matterbridge in Homeassistant.
Just clone the repo or copy the 'docker-compose.yml'.

## Important
This is under construction. Please check the repo regularly for update.

To support a Matter compatible Coordinator you can create a `docker-compose.override.yml`file and mount it as a volume.
